# `add_to_stage`

Adds one or more Bifrost-USD prim definitions to a new or existing USD stage. This creates USD prims on the stage.

## Inputs

### `stage`

The USD stage to add to. If nothing is connected, an empty stage is created. You can right-click on the port and choose **Connect Node** to quickly add and connect a node that opens or creates a new stage.

### `prim_definitions`

The list of Bifrost-USD prim definitions to add. You can right-click on the port and then choose **Create Node** to quickly add and connect any of several common inputs.

## `Settings`

These settings apply to all added prims.

### `enable`

Toggle this off to skip the addition of prims, and output the unmodified stage instead.

### `parent_path`

The path of a prim to which the connected prims are to be added as children. For example, if this is `/set/geo/` and a connected prim definition has the path `/street/car`, the prim becomes `/set/geo/street/car` on the stage. The leading slash is required for an absolute path.
- If `parent_path` is omitted, the prims are added to the root.
- If one or more prims in the full path do not already exist on the stage, "placeholder" prims are automatically added to the hierarchy using the `def` specifier. The specifier of these can be changed downstream in the graph using another `add_to_stage` node.

### `layer_index`

The index of the layer to which the prim definitions are to be added. Sublayers are indexed consecutively with 0 at the bottom of the stack and each successive layer above the previous. Layer 0 holds the weakest opinions, which is the opposite of how sublayers are ordered when using the USD Python or C++ API. The default of -1 refers to the root layer. The default of -1 refers to the root layer. If you specify an index that does not exist, layer -1 is used.

Note that you cannot specify a layer in a Bifrost-USD stage by name because the stage exists in memory rather than on disk. The identifier comprises a random hash (followed by an optional human-readable tag), and the hash can change each time the graph is executed.

### `use_material_name_or_tag`

Assigns prims with material tags to materials with matching tags. If no material has a matching tag, this option tries to match a prim's tag with a material's name instead. If there is still no match, then no material is assigned.

## Output

### `out_stage`

The stage with the added prim definitions.
